  <h1>Royal Nickname Generator</h1>
  <p>Enter first name and last name. And follow my absoulte commands ha ha ha. Funny, it's almost like I'm being ironic. But irony is poison as they say, and those peope can shove it up their pretentious being. As you see, there are many forms of irony that can be used, some more obvious than others. And I understand by writting this that my over serious thing can be seen as ironic as I'm treating something that isn't serious, serious. But nobody likes somebody who's self aware of being self aware, it can be seen as wishy washness. And other clearly amazing things.</p>
